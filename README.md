Built with MVVM to keep the code clean, organized, and easy to test.

Used protocol-oriented programming and preferred structs for safer state and better memory use.

Added dependency injection so the ViewModel can switch between real and mock services.

Added pagination with flexible page and limit values.

Networking uses Swift’s modern async/await.

Marked the ViewModel with @MainActor for safe UI updates.

Created two mock services for testing (success + failure).

Added basic accessibility identifiers.

Built the entire UI with SwiftUI.

Uses AsyncImage for fast, cached image loading.

Added a simple error enum to manage error messages cleanly.
